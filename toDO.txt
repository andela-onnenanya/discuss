=====================================
Model your `comment-app` to accommodate translations for the comments.
Each comment should have a translation in 3 languages (French, German, Spanish)
stored in a relational database.

Comment: merge sort is Lovely
Translations: Fr - French: merge sort is Lovely
              Gr - German: merge sort is Lovely
              Sp - Spanish: merge sort is Lovely
I would also like different users to assign a score to the comments.
